comment_en = "Iku Nagae's theme.\n\nThis is a pretty old story, but I saw an oarfish mummy in an aquarium once.\nI'd seen pictures before, but seeing it in person leaves a totally different impact.\nIt's a flat and unusually long fish.\nIt's hard to believe it's something from this world.\n\nThis is the theme song for that sort of Iku."

comment_en = "Tenshi Hinanawi's theme.\n\nThe key image is of a very willful and self-centered character.\nShe's as self-centered as Remilia is.\n\nHeaven is really full of enlightened persons of character, but even among them there are inferior ones like her.\nStill, that gives her an almost human feel. Turning it around, you might say she's an oasis within Heaven.\n\nNot that this has anything to do with the song, really."
