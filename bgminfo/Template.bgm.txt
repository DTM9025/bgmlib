# Touhou BGM Extractor Info File Template

# Create a copy of this file to add support for a new game.
# Make sure the extension of this file is "bgm", the extractor won't find it otherwise!

# Edit rules
# ==========
# - All strings have to be enquoted.
# - Numbers can also be specified in hexadecimal format, prefixed with 0x.
# - If a multi-language string (without "_jp") would be the same in both languages, you can only specify <keyname> without a language suffix (like "<keyname>_en").
#   The string will then be used for both languages.
# - You SHOULD delete any information which won't be used for the game you're editing. However, the program won't add keys itself which are missing here.
#   I'm too lazy to implement this and none of you would care anyway.
# ==========
# That's all.
