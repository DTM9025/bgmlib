comment_jp = "結構かっこよく生まれ変わったんじゃないかな。\nそれにしても懐かしい・・・"

name_jp = "永遠の巫女"
comment_en = "This melody had quite an impact on me. Even now, I'll find myself playing it when I compose music."
comment_jp = "このメロディは、自分の中では衝撃的で、いまでも曲を作るとき、思わず弾いてしまいます。"

name_jp = "The Positive and Negative"
comment_en = "I get the feeling there are a few melodic differences from my current music. What could they be...?\n(The chord progression hasn't changed much. (^^; )"
comment_jp = "今の曲と、若干なにかメロディに差がある気がするんですけど、何だろう・・・\n（コード進行はあんまり変わらん(^^; ）"

name_jp = "Highly Responsive to Prayers"
comment_en = "I arranged an old musical piece, and now this one feels really gloomy.\nIt's a calm piece, which really is a rarity for this game, isn't it."
comment_jp = "昔の曲をアレンジしてると、かなり暗い曲だな～と感じます。\nこのゲームでは、非常に珍しく落ち着いた曲なんじゃないかな。"
name_en = "Highly Responsive to Prayers"

[05]
name_jp = "東方怪奇談"
comment_en = "I composed this song for the first game I ever made, so I put quite a bit of thought into it.\nAll the \"Touhou OOO\"-style game titles also stem from this piece."
comment_jp = "この曲、私が生まれて初めて作ったゲーム用の曲です。だから、かなり思い入れがあります。\n東方○○○っていうゲームタイトルもこの曲から取りました。"
name_en = "Eastern Strange Discourse"

[06]
name_jp = "天使伝説"
comment_en = "This piece is the model for my current boss themes.\nIt doesn't seem a lot different now, but somehow the older song has WEIGHT to it (^^;;\nOr maybe it's that the current pieces are light? (I don't think that's it either...)"
comment_jp = "今のボスの曲の原型となった曲です。\n今も大差無い様だけど、なぜか昔の曲の方が重い～(^^;;\nというか今の曲の方が軽いのか？（そんなことも無いような・・・）"
name_en = "Angel's Legend"

[07]
name_jp = "Oriental Magician"
comment_en = "This might be a catchy arrangement, since it was originally sooo dark.\nLooks like I inadvertently made all the songs Japanese style...totally different from how I do it now. (;_;)"
comment_jp = "ちょっと、ノリよくアレンジしてるかも。元は暗かったからな～\nなにげに、どの曲も和風だな～今と大違いだな～(;_;)"
name_en = "Oriental Magician"

[08]
name_jp = "破邪の小太刀"
comment_en = "This is the most bright-eyed song in the game, I think.\nSo I tried arranging it to emphasize that feel."
comment_jp = "このゲームで一番明る目な曲じゃないかな。\nだから、そういった感じを強調したアレンジにしてみました。"
name_en = "Blade of Banishment"

[09]
name_jp = "魔鏡"
comment_en = "This piece has a pretty good feel to it.\nThis kind of tune (with a touch of mystery) is indispensable for mid-game.\nWell, not that my current stuff's all that different."
comment_jp = "この曲はなかなかいい感じかも。\n中盤戦には欠かせないよね、こういう曲（ちょっぴり謎）。\nでま～、いまの曲も大差ないんだが。"
name_en = "Magic Mirror"

[10]
name_jp = "the Legend of KAGE"
comment_en = "This is the second song in my heart, composed right after \"Strange Oriental Discourse\".\nOriginally, the tempo was pretty messed up, so I slowed it a bit."
comment_jp = "この曲は「東方怪奇談」の次に作った、自分の中では２曲目に当たるものです。\n元が余りにも目茶苦茶なテンポだったんで少し遅くしてます。"
name_en = "the Legend of KAGE"

[11]
name_jp = "いざ、倒れ逝くその時まで"
comment_en = "Nice piece for endgame, huh? Once you finally get here, it doesn't feel all that Japanese, does it.\nThis may be a lot easier on the ears than the original piece."
comment_jp = "この曲はラストっぽくていいですねここに来て初めて、和風っぽくないですね～。\n元曲より大分聞き安くなったかな。"
name_en = "Now, Until the Moment You Die"

[12]
name_jp = "Civilization of Magic"
comment_en = "I've almost never used this piece. It's only used for a brief moment in the game.\nI actually composed this for its title, so I couldn't use it afterward...\nFor the arrangement, I tried touching it up to give the feel of its title. (This piece is my favorite.)"
comment_jp = "ほとんど未使用曲です。ゲームではちょっとしか使ってません。\n本当はタイトル用に作った曲なんですが、ちょっと使えなくて・・・\nアレンジではタイトルっぽく仕上げてみました。（この曲はお気に入り）"
name_en = "Civilization of Magic"

[13]
name_jp = "星幽天使"
comment_en = "This song unfolds so fast, it's like, \"Are you kidding me?\".\nIt puts together short phrases.\nAnd yet, did arranging it make it much better?"
comment_jp = "まじかよっ、てくらい展開の速い曲ですね。\n短いフレーズを寄せ集めてます。\nそれでもアレンジで大分ましになったのかな？"
name_en = "Angel of a Distant Star"

[14]
name_jp = "アイリス"
comment_en = "Short and sweet. Please envision irises.\nYou might even see Shangri-La.\n(It's pretty mysterious.)"
comment_jp = "短くていい感じ。アイリスの花でも想像して下さい。\n桃源郷が見えてきそうだし。\n（だいたい謎）"
name_en = "Iris"
