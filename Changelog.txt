- 2011/03/08 (Version 2.0)
* Splitted bgmlib off musicroom to make it a standalone library
* Added support for games to be tag-only, without any extraction...
* ... and used this to add support for the PC-98 game soundtracks from Akyu's Untouched Score and every single CD ZUN ever released
* The BGM and configuration file parser can now add keys not present in the loaded file.
  Also, loading and parsing was speeded up by a factor of 6 (... as if it would seriously matter).
